# INS LANG

## How it works
main.py reads
- test.ins file and passes integers convertible objects to a list
- if it sees + op, it calls add fn
- if it sees . op, it prints the result

## Syntax
- {int int int . .} + .
- See test.ins file to know more

## Caviets
- You have to use test.ins only
- Only plus operation via "+" and dump operation via "." is supported
- It runs by executing main.py actually, thats what ins-run also does. I know very weird.

## Examples
```
$ echo "2 2 4 4 + ." > test.ins
$ ./ins-run

```
